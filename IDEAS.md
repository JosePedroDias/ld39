Running out of power


Who we are

* robot/machine
* factory management/maintenance
* human depending on faulty machinery
* the world, trying to aid the character
* we're power itself and we must feed who needs us


What needs to be done

* evacuation going on - need to make machines cope with humans, get somewhere without dying and/or with time limit. think lemmings
  (traffic lights changing, railroad path choosing, bridge placement, place barriers)
  -> heavy work on simulating actors such as cars and people interacting with roads, etc.

* mash vehicles in a way to be efficient with low resources
  -> heavy physics and accurate simulation work, not experienced in this

* simple platformer with a twist in locomotion and/or how its movement gets affected over time/environment
  -> could work but need a simple set of original rules...

* racing game in a post-apocalyptic scenario - we must reach the other side of the city, dodging faulty traffic and scared mobs
  -> heavy work on level generation and maybe on the simulation itself. rad though

* puzzle - setup a circuit such that the level mission is accomplished. think the incredible machine / pipe mania
  -> relatively straightforward to setup the engine. hard to do challenging/original levels

* solve engineering problems. think pontifex
  -> same problems as prev, with harder engine setup

* minimalist racing game. think micromachines
  -> twist is? level design? car design? car response to usage

* platformer with dynamic terrain and grapple hook. think worms/liero
  -> vs fight? lemmings get to somewhere?
