# LD39 - gas it up


This is my Ludum Dare 39 compo entry.


## Game summary

  * rules
    * 1HP, must pick fuel periodically (in tough spots) and may pick coins
    * constant player movement in XX
    * vertical impulses to keep ship above ground

  * items
    * gas (required to keep gas level above 0 else game over)
    * coins (best effort. catching all in a level unlocks full level completion)
    * power ups

  * score
    * survived game time and picked coins

  * obstacles
    * static platforms
    * moving platforms (recurring movement/rotation)
      * gates opening/closing
      * rotating elements

  * item placement
    * items can be static, but also tied to platforms and or with assigned paths (if so, one must grasp them fast otherwise too hard)

  * enemies (not sure these are necessary given the game constraints, only relevant if we can affect them in some way)
    * classic patrolling movement around point
    * sine wave movement Ã  lÃ  r-type

  * power ups
    * invincible
    * speed up/down XX speed
    * power up centers camera ahead of player, allowing to see more of the level
    * rotate the camera (harder to reason about)
    * kill visible enemies
    * kill destructible obstacles (are these any of these?)
    * invert YY gravity

  * game appearance / vibe
    * average/poor art, best effort (most likely)
    * crude solids with vibrant colors (geometry dash)
    * dramatic with normal lights


  * nice to haves
    * decent sprites (may drop compo to jam and use artwork from elsewhere such as [kenney](https://kenney.nl/assets))
    * music (either: none, use free licensed, from a friend - therefore jam)
    * sfx (might do with simple generators since the theme is simple enough)
    * lighting as an obstacle (would require sprites to have )
